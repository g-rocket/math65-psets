\begin{problem}
	For each linear system of DEs given below,
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Classify the origin as a saddle, center, spiral, deficient node, improper node or
		  star node,
		\item Identify it as neutrally stable, unstable or asymptotically
		  stable (you may refer to Tables 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 in Borrelli \& Coleman, which is available as a handout on our Sakai site),
		\item Sketch the orbital portrait for each system. You may use
		  ODEToolkit (\url{http://odetoolkit.hmc.edu}), Mathematica, or some
		  other program to help you, but you should try to see if you can draw
		  it yourself first without hints from the computer.

\begin{problem}
	Write down a system of linear, homogeneous, first-order, constant-coefficient 
	differential equations that could support the following graph. 
	The straight trajectories (and their orientations) are the only ones that you must preserve. 
	The large arrows are just meant to show the general trend of the trajectories in the rest of
  the phase plane. 
  Also, use ODEToolkit or Mathematica or some other computer program to draw some solution 
  trajectories for your differential equations to show that they match the diagram below.

\begin{problem}
	Here is a simplified diagram of a car. 
	The suspension at each axle (springs, tires, and shock absorbers) 
	is modeled by a spring and damper. 
	Only a spring is shown in the figure below, but assume that there is some damping there too.
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,height=1.4in]{img/hw08-car} 
	\end{center}

	The motion of this system is governed by these four coupled differential equations. 
	(You don't have to derive them---
	just appreciate that someone has gone through the mechanics for you.) 
	\begin{align*}
		\dot{y_1}&=\frac{p_m}{m}-\frac{L_1p_\psi}{J} \\
		\dot{y_2}&=\frac{p_m}{m}+\frac{L_2p_\psi}{J} \\
		\dot{p_m}&=-k_1y_1-k_2y_2-\frac{R_1+R_2}{m}p_m-\frac{L_2R_2-L_1R_1}{J}p_{\psi} \\
		\dot{p_\psi}&=L_1k_1y_1-L_2k_2y_2-\frac{L_2R_2-L_1R_1}{m}p_m-\frac{L_2^2R_2+L_1^2R_1}{J}p_{\psi}
	\end{align*}
	The four dependent variables are $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$, 
	the vertical displacements of the front and rear axles, respectively, 
	and $p_m(t)$ and $p_{\psi}(t)$, 
	the linear momentum and angular momentum about the mass center of the system, respectively. 
	Here, $J$ is the moment of inertia of the car about its center of mass, 
	$L_1$ and $L_2$ are the horizontal distances between 
	the front and rear axles and the center of mass, 
	$k_1$ and $k_2$ are the spring constants, and 
	$R_1$ and $R_2$ are the damping resistance constants.
	
	Use the following parameter values: $J=mr^2$ with 
	$m=\SI{1250}{\kg}$ and $r^2=\SI{1.6}{\m^2}$, 
	$k_1=\SI{30}{\kN\per\m}$, $k_2=\SI{32}{\kN\per\m}$, 
	$L_1=\SI{1.4}{\m}$ and $L_2=\SI{1.6}{\m}$.

	\begin{subproblems}
		\subproblem
			This is a system of four first-order, linear, homogeneous, autonomous differential equations. 
			Write it in linear algebra form. 
			Breathe a sign of relief that in this entire problem you 
			are not being asked to calculate $Pe^{Dt}P^{-1}$ to solve these ODEs.
			\begin{solution}
				
			\end{solution}
		\subproblem 
			You already know that the solution to this system of ODEs is going to involve terms like
		  $e^{\lambda_1 t}$, $e^{\lambda_2 t}$, $e^{\lambda_3 t}$, $e^{\lambda_4 t}$, 
		  where the $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues to the system matrix. 
		  One common misconception is that $y_1$ involves only $e^{\lambda_1 t}$, 
		  that $y_2$ involves only $e^{\lambda_2 t}$, etc. 
		  By imagining how the calculation $Pe^{Dt}P^{-1}$ would be performed 
		  (but not actually performing it), 
		  explain why it is more likely that all four dependent variables will consist of a 
		  linear combination of all four exponential terms.
			\begin{solution}
				
			\end{solution}
		\subproblem 
			Suppose that there is no damping in the system ($R_1=R_2=0$). 
			Use a technology to help you calculate the eigenvalues of the system matrix. 
			What kind of motion (undamped, underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped oscillation)
			characterizes the behavior of the system? 
			What are its vibrational frequencies? 
			(In other words, if there is a term like $\cos(\sigma t)$ in the solution, 
			what is the $\sigma$?) 
			Report these frequencies with the proper units.
			\begin{solution}
				
			\end{solution}
		\subproblem 
			Now suppose $R_1=R_2=\SI{4000}{\N\s^2\per\m}$. 
			What kind of motion characterizes the behavior of the system?
			\begin{solution}
				
			\end{solution}
		\subproblem 
			Now suppose $R_1=R_2=R$. 
			Find a value of $R$ for which the behavior of the system is no longer oscillatory. 
			(You don't have to do this in a systematic way. 
			Just picking numbers until you find what you need is fine.)
